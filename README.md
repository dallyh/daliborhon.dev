## Info

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) project for my personal website, which I play to use as a blog.
The project is continually in development, as I also take it as an opportunity to learn something new.

This is a fully static website hosted on GitHub pages, using a fully static CMS for content management.

I guess for experienced developers a lot of things in this repo will not make any sense, however, everybody has to start somewhere.

## Stack

-   Frameworks:
    -   [Astro](https://astro.build)
    -   Some of the UI: [React](https://react.dev/)
    -   Internationalization [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
-   Content Management System: [Static CMS](https://staticcms.org)
    -   User authorization: [Static CMS GitHub OAuth provider](https://github.com/dallyh/static-cms-gh-oauth-provider)

## Deployment

Deployments are done either on a new commit to the `main` branch (production), or on a new pull request for `main` branch.

Pull request creates a new build just for that particular pull request, which is used to preview the site.
Previews are hosted [here](https://github.com/dallyh/deploy-previews).

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
