# Welcome to my [Website!](https://daliborhon.dev)

## Info

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) project for my personal website, which I plan to use as a blog.
The project is continually in development, as I also take it as an opportunity to learn something new.

This project and site is mostly just for me to have some coding fun. I don't really consider myself a developer, I'm more of a hobbyist when it comes to writing code.
