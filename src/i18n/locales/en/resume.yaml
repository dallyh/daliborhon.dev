    Business analysis is not an unfamiliar concept to me. This involves close
    cooperation with the customer, the development department, project managers
    and the like. Analytical documents, process analyses, use-case diagrams and
    infrastructure designs are all part of my daily routine.

    I consider development as icing on the cake, as i enjoy writing code. Over
    time, I have learned in my work positions to understand code, how things
    work in it and how everything fits together. From the beginning, I mainly
    used the scripting interfaces of the implemented software, primarily in C#
    and also VBScript language. Over time I also started to get involved in
    internal development, and I started helping with development of internal
    extension modules as well as various tools.

    implementation of software for the extraction of data from documents and
    document management systems ( primarily M-Files or tailor-made solutions in
