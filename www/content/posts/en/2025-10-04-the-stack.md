# My Technology Stack in 2025: Fast, Simple, and Fully Ownable

I like stacks that are *boring* (read easy to learn) in the best way: fast to ship, easy to reason about, and fully under my control. Here’s the setup that runs this site today.

## TL;DR

- **Frontend:** **[Astro](https://astro.build)** — islands architecture, zero-JS by default
- **Comments:** **[Giscus (GitHub Discussions)](https://giscus.app)**
- **Backend & DB:** API routes + **PostgreSQL**  
- **Emails:** **[Resend](https://resend.com)**  
- **Analytics:** **[Umami](https://umami.is/)** (privacy-friendly)  
- **Monitoring:** **[Beszel](https://beszel.dev/)** & **[Betterstack](https://betterstack.com/)**
- **Orchestration:** **[Coolify](https://coolify.io)** (PaaS on my own server)  
- **Code:** **[GitHub](https://github.com)**  
- **Infra:** **[Hetzner](https://hetzner.com)** VPS  
- **DNS & domain:** **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)**

## Why this stack?

- **Own the core**: Database, analytics, and monitoring live on my boxes which I have full control of.
- **Deploy like it’s Vercel—without Vercel**: Coolify gives me a PaaS experience on Hetzner and just makes things easier.
- **Performance first**: Astro is a simple and, by default, also a static builder. Pages load fast, and lighthouse is happy. It also has great DX.
- **Email that actually delivers**: Resend keeps the pipeline simple, with good deliverability and a pleasant DX.  
- **Privacy by default**: Umami tracks what matters without following users around the web.

## Frontend: Astro

I choose Astro because it's easy to work with, prerenders pages by default and has MDX support practically out of the box. Comments on the website are hosted on [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions), this uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app) in the background.

## Data: PostgreSQL

Currently Postgres powers only the analytics (Umami). I'm familiar with Postgres from my work, so it was a no-brainer.

## Email: Resend

I use Resend because it's clean, easy to use, and it also has a really generous free tier for hobby projects (also Coolify supports it).

## Analytics: Umami

I run Umami ([analytics.daliborhon.dev](https://analytics.daliborhon.dev/share/PLvxy1iAjOUgirKl/daliborhon.dev)) myself because it’s lightweight and respectful. The analytics are not really needed because my website is not visited that much, but still having some form of them is nice (also I like graphs).

## Monitoring: Beszel & Betterstack

Beszel only monitors the resources on the local server. Although Coolify has monitoring too, it is not as detailed. Betterstack ([status.daliborhon.dev](https://status.daliborhon.dev)) periodically pings everything I run, so I don't have to check everything by myself.

## Orchestration: Coolify on Hetzner

Coolify is the glue. It handles:
- Dockerized apps (Astro, Umami, Beszel, Postgres)
- Automatic TLS (via its built-in proxy)
- Environment variables & secrets
- Deploy hooks from GitHub repositories

Deploy flow: push to main → Coolify pulls, builds, runs → health checks pass → traffic switches to a new version.

## Infra: Hetzner + Cloudflare

I choose Hetzner mainly because it has EU datacenters and pretty cheap VPS pricing. Cloudflare is used to handle domains, DNS and bot (AI crawlers) protection and it has a generous free tier (CDN caching is also nice).

## Costs
- Hetzner VPS (single box): €5/mo
- Domain: €11/yr
- Cloudflare: free tier
- Resend: free tier
- Betterstack: free tier
