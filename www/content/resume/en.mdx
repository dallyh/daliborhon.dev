## Intro

### +55 Completed Projects

During my years as a business consultant, I have already completed more than 50 projects. These include smaller projects, but also projects that take months or years to complete.
Most of these projects mainly include the implementation of software for the extraction of data from documents and document management systems ( primarily M-Files or tailor-made solutions in MS SharePoint).

#### Business Analysis

Business analysis is not an unfamiliar concept to me. This involves close cooperation with the customer, the development department, project managers and the like.
Analytical documents, process analyses, use-case diagrams and infrastructure designs are all part of my daily routine.

#### Implementation

I also have experience in the actual implementation and installation of various software, primarily intended for the Windows Server OS.
As for example this software includes FlexiCapture and also MSSQL Server. This also includes configuration of such software and installation/configuration of other necessary components such as IIS.

#### Programming

I consider development as icing on the cake, as i enjoy writing code. Over time, I have learned in my work positions to understand code, how things work in it and how everything fits together.
From the beginning, I mainly used the scripting interfaces of the implemented software, primarily in C# and also VBScript language.
Over time I also started to get involved in internal development, and I started helping with development of internal extension modules as well as various tools.
